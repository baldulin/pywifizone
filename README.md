## PyWifiZone

PyWifiZone measures wifi-footprints in different locations, and tries locate a 
wifi device based on this data. Right now this means the wifi device must check
for the wifi-networks around it.

A Command Line Toll is provided named **pywifi**

## Requirements

PyWifiZone needs the linux command **iwlist**, and for full completion 
**iwconfig** as well as **sed** and a **bash** compatible shell.

## State

The current version is supposed to be stable. Note thought that there are no 
tests yet.
